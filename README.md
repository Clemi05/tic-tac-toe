## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I learn how to use array and object destructoring and also the every() method:

```js
function isDraw() {
  return [...cellElements].every(cell => {
    return cell.classList.contains(CROSS_CLASS) ||
      cell.classList.contains(CIRCLE_CLASS)
  })
}
```

I also learned about the some() method:

```js
function checkWin(currentClass) {
  return WINNING_COMBINATIONS.some(combination => {
    return combination.every(index => {
      return cellElements[index].classList.contains(currentClass)
    })
  })
}
```

### Continued development

Following this project, I will continue working on small JavaScript projects (calculator or 2048 game) to exercise my self and improve my JavaScript and CSS skills. I am also gone learn more about React.
